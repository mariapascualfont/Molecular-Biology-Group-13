To browse this repository, there's two main file threads: ab-initio and homology-based. Each have a .sh script containing all the commands used during the procedure and a .txt file that explains how we approached the gene annotation. It's relevant to mention that we started with homology-based methods.The other files, in .fa and .gff formats, contain the various predictions and sequences used throughout the project.
