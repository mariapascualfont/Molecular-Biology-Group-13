To browse this repository: 

There's three main file threads: ab-initio, homology-based and final_analysis. The first two have a .txt file containing the explanation of the process done and a .sh script with the computations needed. Final_analysis contains an explanation and memory of the project, and also the final conclusions. The other files contain fasta and fgg representation of the different gene transcripts used throughout the project. This includes the original file contig_13.fa.
