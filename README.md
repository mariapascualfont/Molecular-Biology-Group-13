To browse this repository: 
There's three main file threads: ab-initio, homology-based and final_analysis. The first two have a .txt file containing the explanation of the process done and a .sh script with the computations needed. Final_analysis contains an explanation and memory of the project, and also the final conclusions.

Function of SOD: 
Superoxide dismutase is an antioxidant enzyme in the fish antioxidant defense system, which can remove excess reactive oxygen species and protect fish from stress-induced oxidative damage. 
Cu/Zn-SOD mRNA is highly expressed in the liver, brain, and eye, but lowly showed in the stomach, gill, spleen, skin, and muscle.
The SOD is directrly associated with longer lifespans in some model systems, this indicates that aging and SOD are also related. Interestingly, caloric restriction increases the resistance of organisms to oxidative stress, suggesting that there may be a relationship between stress resistance (induced by SOD) and aging.
