Ab-initio methods use gene content information and signals in the genomic sequence, that in this case will be used to predict the intron areas of a DNA sequence.
We first pass it through gene prediction softwares. 

1. GeneID
(species is assumed to be Tetraodon nigroviridis, or puffer fish, for the conclusions of our homology-based methods)

# Sequence contig_13 - Length = 5227 bps
# Optimal Gene Structure. 1 genes. Score = 2.57 
# Gene 1 (Reverse). 2 exons. 60 aa. Score = 2.57 
contig_13	geneid_v1.2	Terminal	282	389	 0.52	-	0	contig_13_1
contig_13	geneid_v1.2	First	4962	5033	 2.05	-	0	contig_13_1

We now must use bedtools to find the DNA script for these locations.

2. FGenesh
(we were able to predict it based on Dario rerio, or zebrafish, this time, more according to the previous results.)

 Number of predicted genes 1: in +chain 0, in -chain 1.
 Number of predicted exons 5: in +chain 0, in -chain 5.

3. Genescan
The webpage was down so we couldn't use this predictor. 

Next, we continued with the analysis. 

4. Put all predictions together

We'll first concatenate both exons from GeneID and then put all the others together in a single file. 
Then, we'll put all predictions together with our original gene in document contig_13_allpredicted.fa

5. Run a TCoffee Multiple Sequence Alignment

Because there's a sequence length limit, we couldn't run the original transcript with the predictions. In another webpage without this restriction, we realized that running the three sequences at one provided no useful insights. The predicted genes appeared scattered throughout the original transcript. 

We decided to stick with the strategy of running the T-coffee just with the predicted parts to see how similar they were to each other. The result was a score of 405, so it is quite satisfactory. Most of the transcripts don't fully coincide, but there are some regions with exact coincidences, which indicates that it is very likely a coding region. We can see how Fgenesh is longer and geneid just coincides in some parts. That is because Fgenesh, that was predicted with zebrafish, contained 5 exons, while geneid, that was computed according to puffer fish, only detected 2. We have more confidence of Fgenesh, as zebrafish was also analyzed in homology-based methodology. 

Finally, something we realised of this analysis is that the coding part of the transcript that was given is very small. That matches the blast search that we performed on the beggining, as though the similarities between our sequence and the predicted genes were high, the query cover was quite low. Possibly because of this reason, because there are only small regions which actually correspond to coding regions.
