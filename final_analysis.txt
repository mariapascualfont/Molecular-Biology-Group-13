For this project we performed three different lines of work, summarized in .txt files and shell/python scripts.

1. Get the aminoacid sequence and perform a blast to first try to identify our gene and its species
2. Perform ab initio methods for gene prediction
3. Perform homology-based methods for gene prediction
