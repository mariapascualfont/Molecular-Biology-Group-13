For homology based methods, we work with databases of known proteins and find alignments within them. 

Part A: Homology-based annotation

1. Find  annotations from related species:
- Perform blastx searc of the contic_13 sequence against the nr database.
- Using the official website:  https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
- We saw different proteins in the table of blast and decided to keep the following proteins:

 Danio aesculapii, Danio rerio, Paramisgurnus dabryanus, Hemybarbus mylodon.

There was a protein named "hypothetical protein" but we decided not to use it because we don't know what codes for and don't know the function.
      
- We saved one of the matching proteins into text file (fasta format).



2. Predict gene using Exonerate:
    - We aligned the protein to the DNA sequence:
