For homology based methods, we work with databases of known proteins and find alignments within them. 

Part A: Homology-based annotation

1. Find  annotations from related species:
- Perform blastx searc of the contic_13 sequence against the nr database.
- Using the official website:  https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi
- We saw different proteins in the table of blast and decided to keep the following proteins:

Danio aesculapii, Danio rerio, Paramisgurnus dabryanus, Hemybarbus mylodon.

There was a protein named "hypothetical protein" but we decided not to use it because we don't know what codes for and don't know the function.
      
- We saved one of the matching proteins into text file (fasta format).



2. Predict gene using Exonerate:
- We aligned the protein to the DNA sequence:

The first alignment is with superoxide dismutase [Cu-Zn] [Danio aesculapii]: 

-It aligns the protein XP_056323559.1 with de contig_13. It detects a gene between the positions 285 and 5033 en the DNA. (It is long) 

-The orientation is inverse(-), in the complementary strand.

-The protein aligns in a 98.68% of identity and 99.34% of similitud, that is a good coincidence.

-There are 5 exons which all have 100% identity but one that has 93.55%. And 4 introns.



3.Select only exon features:

contig_13	exonerate:protein2genome:local	exon	4962	5033	.	-	.	insertions 0 ; deletions 0 ; identity 100.00 ; similarity 100.00
contig_13	exonerate:protein2genome:local	exon	3308	3404	.	-	.	insertions 3 ; deletions 0 ; identity 93.55 ; similarity 96.77
contig_13	exonerate:protein2genome:local	exon	2699	2768	.	-	.	insertions 0 ; deletions 0 ; identity 100.00 ; similarity 100.00
contig_13	exonerate:protein2genome:local	exon	478	595	.	-	.	insertions 0 ; deletions 0 ; identity 100.00 ; similarity 100.00
contig_13	exonerate:protein2genome:local	exon	285	389	.	-	.	insertions 0 ; deletions 0 ; identity 100.00 ; similarity 100.00





4.Extract exon sequences:
-We used bedtools to get the exon sequences in fasta format:

5.Concatente exons into a single sequence:

6.Compare homology-based and ab-initio predictions:
